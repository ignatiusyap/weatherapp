# weatherapp
React app that features a search API call

Possible future plans:
- Add in a login page with user authentication
- Create RestFUL API to a data base

Assumption:
1. A front end only app where the user data is stored in a React state.
2. App is used per browser session per user only.
3. Closing browser refreshes user data.
